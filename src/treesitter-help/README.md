tree-sitter-vimdoc
==================

This grammar intentionally support a subset of the vimdoc "spec"
([ref1](https://neovim.io/doc/user/helphelp.html#help-writing),
[ref2](https://github.com/nanotee/vimdoc-notes));
predictable results are the primary goal, so that _output_ formats (e.g. HTML)
are well-formed; the _input_ (vimdoc) is secondary. The first step should
always be to try to fix the input rather than insist on a grammar that handles
vimdoc's endless quirks.

Overview
--------

- `block` is the main top-level node which contains `line` and `line_li` nodes.
  - delimited by blank line(s) or any line starting with `<` (codeblock terminator).
- `line`:
  - contains atoms (words, tags, taglinks, â€¦)
  - contains headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) because `codeblock` terminated by
    "implicit stop" (no terminating `<`) consumes blank lines, so `block` has
    no way to end.
  - contains `column_heading` because `<` (the `codeblock` terminating char)
    can appear at the start of `column_heading`.
- `line_li` ("list item")
  - consumes lines until blank line, codeblock, or next listitem.
  - nesting is ignored: indented listitems are parsed as siblings.
- `codeblock`:
  - contained by `line` or `line_li`. Because ">" can start
    a codeblock at the end of any line.
  - contains `line` nodes without `word` nodes, it's just the full
    raw text line including whitespace. This is somewhat dictated by its
    "preformatted" nature; parsing the contents would require loading a "child"
    language (injection). See [#2](https://github.com/neovim/tree-sitter-vimdoc/issues/2).
  - the terminating `<` (and any following whitespace) is discarded (anonymous).
- `h1` = "Heading 1": `======` followed by text and optional `*tags*`.
- `h2` = "Heading 2": `------` followed by text and optional `*tags*`.
- `h3` = "Heading 3": only UPPERCASE WORDS, followed by optional `*tags*`.

Known issues
------------

- Input must end with newline/EOL (`\n`). Grammar does not support files without EOL.
- Input must end with a blank line. Though this doesn't seem to matter in practice.
- Spec requires that `codeblock` delimiter ">" must be preceded by a space
  (" >"), not a tab. But currently the grammar doesn't enforce this. Example:
  `:help lcs-tab`.
- `url` doesn't handle _surrounding_ parens. E.g. `(https://example.com/#yay)` yields `word`
- `url` doesn't handle _nested_ parens. E.g. `(https://example.com/(foo)#yay)`
- `column_heading` currently only recognizes tilde "~" preceded by space (i.e.
  "foo ~" not "foo~"). This covers 99% of :help files, but the grammar should
  probably support "foo~" also.

TODO
----

- `line_modeline` ?
- `tag_heading` : line(s) containing only tags, typically implies a "heading"
  before a block.
